Beginner ReactJS single web page application 

This is a fairly simple web page application using JavaScript, HTML/CSS, and reactJS.
The majority of the code was written in the Notepad Application. Common tags are used such as head, div and footer.
An intermediate understanding of HTML and JavaScript is recommended,  as well as super familiarity with stack overflow and googling things you don't understand.
 
DESCRIPTION
The MYF is the main webpage and blog for the recently opened "Museum of Your Future.
This web page will be used to view the latest updates and blogs from 
the Museum of You Future. Please access the html page to view the ReactJS application.

TOOLS USED
Basic text editor such as Notepad was used to develop the MYF web page. 
JavaScript, JSX, HTML5/CSS and ReactJS were used to design the application.

USE
The below libraries need to be downloaded and stored to the src folder in your IDE's project if using this route, 
or have the lines placed within the head tag of your webpage. To start with your design, within your head tag, insert the below script source files:
 
<script src="https://unpkg.com/react@16.1.1/umd/react.development.js"></script>
<script src="https://unpkg.com/react-dom@16.1.1/umd/react-dom.development.js"></script>
<script src="https://unpkg.com/babel-standalone@6/babel.min.js"></script>

The ReactJS libraries were created by Facebook. Including these scripts will allow you to design your application with reactJS tools.
